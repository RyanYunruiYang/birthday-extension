# A Simple Icon-Based Birthday Reminder
To use, download the folder here and click "Load Unpacked" at chrome://extensions/, or install from Chrome Web Store.

Current Features:
- Changing extension icon ("0 days" to "9 days")
- Sorted table of birthdays
- Special message on birthdays

Future Features:
- Persistent/Background Updating of Icon
- Differentiation between different birthdays (Allowing you to "star" certain extra special birthdays)
- Toggleable Year/Age
- Shiftable Table (so that it sorta all birthdays by time-until-the-birthday instead of by month/day)
